##  MyShop App
A simple shop app built with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). The chat app uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), specifically Firebase's Realtime Database and the Firebase authentication package to:
- Store and sync data with a NoSQL cloud database,
- secure authentication methods.

This is a simple shopping app where users can sign up and/or login to:
- View products, add favourite products and add orders from the **Products Overview Screen**,
- View and place orders from the **Cart Screen**,
- View orders from the **Orders Screen**,
- Manage products from the **Manage Products Screen**.
